# UI

## Motivation

For a very long time I wanted to build a nice React based design system and component library. Open source, customizable, simple to use and with a brilliant codebase. Something i'd be really proud of having in portfolio. My main goal is to learn new things and build something truly great in a way I think is the right one. Free from customer restrictions and constraints and requirements where you, as the person who builds it, would only roll your eyes and to instead have a result you're really proud to show your friends, colleagues and potential customers.

I know there are already dozens of good, great, and yes, even brilliant component libraries for React out there. I know that but I still want to take on the challenge that you can still improve the status quo. Better documentation, better accessibility, easier extensibility, modern codebase, smaller file size, more components, more features where they're needed, less features where a smaller API is preferable. There's always something you can do better. And that's my goal. To build a beautiful design system and a component library that is … just better, in one way or the other.

## Goals

The ultimate goals for this yet to be build component library:

- [ ] provide common UI primitives (Inputs, Checkboxes, Buttons, …)
- [ ] provide more complex UI components (Modals, Tabs, …)
- [ ] beautiful and consistent design that is still customizable
- [ ] … and with accessibility in mind
- [ ] fully documented with comprehensible examples
- [ ] high standards in terms of code quality
- [ ] easy to setup and integrate into your application
- [ ] keep the number of dependencies to a minimum
- [ ] smallest file size as possible
- [ ] automate as much as possible (tests, changelog, versioning, …)
- [ ] build something that truly amazes people and makes them actually want to use it
- [ ] production ready for both startup MVPs and large scale corporate applications 
- [ ] build something you would use ever and ever again
- [ ] meaningful tests and high test coverage

… and generally be a great example for how a great product should be developed, managed and maintained.
